# Security Policy

## Security Improvements

This document outlines the security measures implemented in this application and best practices for deployment.

## Recent Security Enhancements

### 1. Removed Exposed Error Logs
- Removed all `error_log` files containing sensitive information
- Added `error_log` to `.gitignore` to prevent future commits

### 2. Secure Session Configuration
- `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE`: Set to `true` in production to ensure cookies are only sent over HTTPS
- `SESSION_HTTP_ONLY`: Set to `true` to prevent JavaScript access to session cookies
- `SESSION_SAME_SITE`: Set to `lax` to protect against CSRF attacks

### 3. Security Headers Middleware
Added comprehensive security headers to all responses:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME-sniffing attacks
- `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Enables XSS protection in older browsers
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information
- `Permissions-Policy` - Restricts access to browser features
- `Content-Security-Policy` - Mitigates XSS and injection attacks

### 4. Environment-Based Seeder Passwords
- Changed hardcoded passwords in seeders to use `SEEDER_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` environment variable
- Default password changed from `password` to `ChangeMe123!`
- **IMPORTANT**: Always change `SEEDER_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` in production environments

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Critical Security Settings

1. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   APP_ENV=production
   APP_DEBUG=false
   APP_KEY=<generate-with-php-artisan-key:generate>
   ```

2. **Session Security**
   ```bash
   SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true
   SESSION_HTTP_ONLY=true
   SESSION_SAME_SITE=lax
   ```

3. **Database Credentials**
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Never commit `.env` file
   - Restrict database access to application server only

4. **Seeder Password**
   ```bash
   SEEDER_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=<use-strong-unique-password>
   ```
   **IMPORTANT**: Change this before running seeders in production!

5. **HTTPS Configuration**
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Configure SSL certificates properly
   - Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

### Additional Security Measures

1. **File Permissions**
   ```bash
   chmod -R 755 storage bootstrap/cache
   chmod -R 644 .env
   ```

2. **Composer Packages**
   - Keep all dependencies updated
   - Run `composer audit` regularly
   - Review security advisories

3. **Database**
   - Use parameterized queries (Laravel does this by default)
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Regular backups

4. **User Authentication**
   - Enforce strong password policies
   - Implement rate limiting on login attempts
   - Consider two-factor authentication

5. **Error Handling**
   - Never display detailed errors in production
   - Log errors securely
   - Monitor logs regularly

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email security@tununue.com instead of using the issue tracker.

## Regular Security Audits

Recommended security checks:
1. Review user permissions and access controls
2. Update all dependencies
3. Check for exposed sensitive files
4. Review database access logs
5. Test authentication and authorization
6. Verify HTTPS configuration
7. Run automated security scanners

## Password Policy

For seeded/test accounts:
- Minimum 12 characters
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Change default passwords immediately after deployment
- Use password managers for secure storage

## Version History

- **v1.0.0** (2025-09-30): Initial security improvements
  - Removed error logs
  - Added security headers
  - Secured session configuration
  - Environment-based seeder passwords
