## Features

Here are some of the core features (as inferred from the project structure):

- User registration, authentication, and account management  
- Role-based access (buyer, seller, admin)  
- Product catalog: listing, browsing, filtering  
- Shopping cart, order placement, and checkout process  
- Payment/invoicing ( order management)  
- Vendor dashboard: manage own listings, orders  
- Admin dashboard: moderate users, manage global settings  
- Notifications, email   
- API endpoints for front-end consumption  
- Responsive UI (via modern front-end tooling)  

You may want to refine this list based on your actual implemented features (e.g. search, ratings, messaging, etc.).

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology / Framework | Purpose / Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | Laravel (PHP) | Core business logic, routing, controllers, models |
| Frontend | Blade + other JS | Templating & interactivity |
| Assets & Build | Vite, Tailwind CSS, PostCSS | Asset bundling, styling, CSS utility |
| Database | MySQL / MariaDB (or any relational DB) | Persisting users, products, orders |
| Testing | PHPUnit, Laravel’s test suites | Unit & feature testing |
| Others | Composer, npm / yarn, artisan CLI | Dependency & command tooling |

From repository: see `composer.json`, `package.json`, `vite.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`, etc.

## Architecture & Key Components

Here is how your repository is organized:

```

app/
bootstrap/
config/
database/
public/
resources/
routes/
storage/
tests/
vendor/
.env.example
artisan
composer.json / composer.lock
package.json / package-lock.json
vite.config.js
tailwind.config.js
postcss.config.js

````

- **app/** — Contains core Laravel app code (Controllers, Models, Middleware, Policies, etc.).  
- **config/** — Configuration files for database, mail, queue, etc.  
- **database/** — Migrations, factories, seeders.  
- **public/** — Web-accessible root (index.php, assets).  
- **resources/** — Views (Blade templates), front-end assets (JS, CSS).  
- **routes/** — Route definitions (web.php, api.php).  
- **storage/** — Logs, compiled views, cached data.  
- **tests/** — Automated tests.  
- **vendor/** — 3rd-party dependencies installed via Composer.  
- **Environment / config files** — `.env.example` as template; sensitive configs in `.env`.( Add .env file to set configurations )

## Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get a local development copy up and running:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PHPDEV-OPS/Tununue-IBL.git
   cd Tununue-IBL


2. **Copy the environment template**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   composer install
   npm install    # or yarn
   ```

4. **Generate application key**

   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. **Configure database & credentials**

   Update `.env` with your DB connection, mail, etc.

6. **Run migrations & seeders**

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --seed
   ```

7. **Build assets**

   ```bash
   npm run dev     # for development
   npm run build   # for production build
   ```

---

## Configuration

You should at minimum configure the following in `.env`:

* `APP_NAME`, `APP_URL`
* `DB_CONNECTION`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`
* `MAIL_MAILER`, `MAIL_HOST`, `MAIL_PORT`, `MAIL_USERNAME`, `MAIL_PASSWORD`, `MAIL_ENCRYPTION`
* (If applicable) Payment gateway keys
* Caching, queue, and other environment-specific settings

Ensure that your environment (local, staging, production) has unique settings.

### Security Configuration

**IMPORTANT:** For security best practices, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)

Before running seeders, configure:
```bash
# In your .env file
SEEDER_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=YourStrongPassword123!
```

For production environments, ensure:
```bash
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true
SESSION_HTTP_ONLY=true
SESSION_SAME_SITE=lax
```

**Never use default passwords in production!** Change all seeded account passwords immediately after deployment.

---

## Usage & Run

Once setup is done:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

You’ll have the application accessible (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).

You can login / register (depending on seeded accounts) and test features:

* Browsing products
* Creating listings (if seller role)
* Placing orders
* Admin operations



---

## Testing

Automated testing helps ensure code quality and stability.

Run the test suite:

```bash
php artisan test
```

Or:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

Add new unit or feature tests under `tests/` directory. Use Laravel’s testing tools (factories, assertions, HTTP testing, etc.).

---

## Deployment

When deploying to production:

* Set appropriate config variables in `.env`
* Use `php artisan config:cache` / `php artisan route:cache` / `php artisan view:cache`
* Build production assets: `npm run build`
* Ensure storage and bootstrap cache directories are writable
* Use a process supervisor (e.g. Supervisor) for `queue:work`
* Backup your database regularly
* Use SSL / HTTPS
* Monitor logs and performance

You may deploy to platforms like DigitalOcean, AWS, Heroku, Laravel Vapor, or shared hosting with PHP support.
